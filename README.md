Print the squares of the numbers 1 - 20. Each number should be on a separate line, next to it the number 2 superscripted, an equal sign and the result. (Example: 102 = 100) 
Prints 10 names with a line break between each name. The list should be alphabetized, and to do this place a subscripted number next to each name based on where it will go in the alphabetized list. (Example: Alan1). Print first, the unalphabetized list with a subscript number next to each name, then the alphabetized list. Both lists should have an <h1> level heading.
